Django’s template layer renders the information to be presented to the user in a designer-friendly format. Using templates, you can generate HTML dynamically. 
The HTML consists of both static as well as dynamic parts of the content. You can have any number of templates depending on the requirement of your project. 
It is also fine to have none of them.

Django has its own template system called the Django template language (DTL). 
Regardless of the backend,you can also load and render templates using Django’s standard admin.

A variable outputs a value from the context, which is a dict-like object mapping keys to values.
Variables are surrounded by {{ and }} like this:

       My first name is {{ first_name }}. My last name is {{ last_name }}.

With a context of {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe'}, this template renders to:

       My first name is John. My last name is Doe
