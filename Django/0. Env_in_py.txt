Why we need Virtual enviroment?
Ans: If we have 2 projects A & B. If A requires package v1.0 and B requires package of v2.0 then,
     For this purpose we need to create a virtual enviroment for each of them.
     For eg: For A- a_venv and for B- b_venv

The virtual environment is an environment which is used by Django to execute an application.
Python provides a tool virtualenv to create an isolated Python environment.

Creating a virtual environment. You must have installed virtualenv package.

Step 1: If not installed install it by typing a command on terminal.

>>>>pip install virtualenv

Step 2: Create a virtual environment. 

>>>python3 -m venv env

Step 3: To Activate Enviroment
>>>cd env

>>>.\Scripts\activate

Step 4: To deactivate the Enviroment Setup

Also to keep your auth keys or secret keys safe i.esecuring your secret keys from external viewers and codebase is to use environment variables.
In Python, you can use the os.getenv('THE_KEY') or os.environ.get('THE_KEY'). 

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY") 
            # or
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
