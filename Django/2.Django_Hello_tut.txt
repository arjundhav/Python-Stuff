Step 1: Creating Project(Demo),
       >> mkvirtualenv my_django_environment  //making virtualenv
       >>django-admin startproject projectname      //creating projectfile

       >>python manage.py runserver
 
        You will get IP go nd visit that 127.0.0.1:8000

      >>python manage.py migrate

      >>python manage.py createsuperuser

      >>Name
      >>email
      >>pass:
      >>cpass:
      >>y
       
      >>python manage.py runserver
      127.0.0.1:8000/admin                /*You will get dashboard of admin*/

Directory of Project:
 ProjectName/
     manage.py
     db.sqlite3  
     mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py    
         
          Demo/
             manage.py
             Demo/
                 __init__.py
                  settings.py
                  urls.py
                  asgi.py
                  wsgi.py
 
      Next we have to create App using command
  
      >>python manage.py startapp Appname(suppose polls here)

 Thatâ€™ll create a directory as below:

      polls/
         __init__.py
         admin.py
         apps.py
         migrations/
             __init__.py
         models.py
         tests.py
         views.py

Step 2:Now to write the first view. Open the file polls/views.py and then import HttpResponse Lib and use django.http
       i.e  from django.http import HttpResponse and then define a function with name Index as below
       Python code: 

            
              def index(request):
                   return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the index.")

 
Step 3: Now the next step is to map these View to URL i.e from polls(App) views.py => urls.py(we have to create manually in APP directory).
        So we will include path of index in urlpatterns, as below:

           In polls/urls.py
               
                    from django.urls import path

                    from . import views

                    urlpatterns = [
                                   path('', views.index, name='index'),
                    ]


    In polls/urls.py, add an import for django.urls.include and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list

         from django.contrib import admin
         from django.urls import include, path

         urlpatterns = [
            path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),     #Function include() allows referencing other URLconfs
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
         ]


Step 4: After this run command:
    
                     >>>python manage.py runserver

        and copy that ip address  http://localhost:8000/polls/
          
   and we get view:
                    Hello World
