## Code introspection in Python
Introspection is an ability to determine the type of an object at runtime. Everything in python is an object. Every object in Python may have attributes and methods. By using introspection, we can dynamically examine python objects.
Code Introspection is used for examining the classes, methods, objects, modules, keywords and get information about them so that we can utilize it.

type()  - This function returns the type of an object.

str()   - This function converts everything into a string 

dir()   - This function return list of methods and attributes associated with that object.

help()  - It is used it to find what other functions do

repr()  - Return string representation of object.

sys()   - Give access to system specific variables, functions

__doc__ - Return some documentation about an object
